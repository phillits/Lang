# Lang {#top}

A collection of C++ classes representing fundamental linguistic units and 
building blocks of language from phonetics to pragmatics.  

A project by Tyler Phillips


### Overview of the project {#overview}

The basic idea of this project is to create a set of classes representing the 
basic components of language, with the goal that these classes could form a 
foundation for a wide variety of linguistic applications.  I'm trying to design
these classes so that they could be used for as many different applications as 
possible.  

### Disclaimer {#disclaimer}

I am a student and a relatively inexperienced programmer.  I hope that this 
project can be useful, but I'm mainly doing it for fun and to improve my 
programming skills.  

### Organization of the project {#overview}

I have split the project up according to the major subfields of linguistics.  
Each subfield has a folder, and each folder contains a header file, an 
implementation file, and a test file.  

### Workflow {#workflow}

I'm following a simple workflow pattern for each subfield: 

  1. Write a header file.  

  2. Write unit tests.  

  3. Implement.  
  
  4. Test and fix as needed.

I welcome contributions if anyone wants to work on this project with me.  Feel

### Documentation {#documentation}

Documentation for this project is provided in the `documentation` directory.  
Documentation is divided into a separate file for each subfield, and an 
overarching table of contents is provided which lists all resources provided by
this project and which subfield they occur in.
