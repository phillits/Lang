Lang

A collection of C++ classes representing fundamental linguistic units and 
building blocks of language from phonetics to discourse analysis.

A project by Tyler Phillips

Overview of the project

The basic idea of this project is to create a set of classes representing the 
basic components of language, with the goal that these classes could form a 
foundation for a wide variety of linguistic applications.  I'm trying to design
these classes so that they could be used for as many different applications as 
possible.

Disclaimer

I am a student and a relatively inexperienced programmer.  I hope that this 
project can be useful, but I'm mainly doing it for fun and to improve my 
programming skills.  

Organization of the project

I have split the project up according to the major subfields of linguistics.  
Each subfield has a folder, and each folder contains a header file, an 
implementation file, and a test file.
